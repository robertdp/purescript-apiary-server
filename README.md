# purescript-apiary-server

This is a small and very opinionated companion to [purescript-apiary](https://github.com/robertdp/purescript-apiary).

It does work, but is more of a prototype or an example implementation. Its basic parts are:

- routing (by exposing a minimal [find-my-way](https://github.com/delvedor/find-my-way) API)
- request decoding and response encoding (checked against Apiary endpoint specs)

For a trivial usage example, look in the `example/` folder.
